1. Download the dataset containing actual and predicted scores for Logistic regression and random forest.
2. Calculate the TP, TN, FP, FN.
3. Compute Precision and recall for both the algorithms.
4. Create a function to compute the F score for different values of beta.
5. Compare the F score at beta 0.5, 1, and 2.  
6. Conclude your results by estimating the best model.
